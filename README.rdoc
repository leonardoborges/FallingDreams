= FallingDreams

I've always enjoyed the art of games development and wanted to give it a try in something achievable from end-to-end.

FallingDreams is a Tetris clone that allowed me the experience of going through the whole process of developing a full game.

=== Building 

Just run ant from the project root and it will create a runnable jar file with the game.

Enjoy :)
